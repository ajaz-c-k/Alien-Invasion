Here is your **updated, clean `README.md`** specifically aligned with:

✅ Your **current Alien Invasion Pygame project**
✅ Your **VS Code workflow** (as shown in your image)
✅ **Persistent `high_score.json` integration** (now included)

# 🚀 Alien Invasion

A **Space Invaders-style game** built using **Pygame**, showcasing clean object-oriented architecture, collision detection, and dynamic gameplay progression while tracking score, level, and high scores persistently.

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

Control your ship to **shoot down waves of aliens** before they reach the bottom. Clear waves to increase your **level and speed**, and track your **high score**, which is saved automatically across game sessions.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Smooth ship movement with keyboard controls  
✅ Bullet firing with collision detection against aliens  
✅ Dynamic alien fleet creation and side-to-side movement  
✅ Score, level, and high score tracking with **persistent high score saving (`high_score.json`)**  
✅ Play button to start and restart the game  
✅ Game pauses with mouse cursor visibility restored on game over

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pygame**
- **JSON** for persistent high score

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajaz-c-k/Alien-Invasion.git
cd Alien-Invasion
````

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Ensure Pygame is installed:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Game

Use VS Code terminal or your command line:

```bash
python alien_invasion.py
```

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

* Building a 2D game with **clean OOP architecture**
* Using **Pygame** for game rendering and event handling
* Implementing sprite management and collision detection
* Saving data persistently using **JSON**
* Using VS Code effectively for Python game development

---

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
